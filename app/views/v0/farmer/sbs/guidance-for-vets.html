    <p class="govuk-body">Defra will pay farmers to have an annual vet-led health and welfare review of their livestock.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The aim of the review is to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions  such as bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in cattle, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs and resistance to parasite treatments in sheep</li>
      <li>improve the welfare of animals</li>
      <li>increase productivity</li>
      <li>advise farmers about veterinary medicines and vaccinations</li>
      <li>help Defra understand more about the health and welfare of the national herd and flock to inform policy decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The review will:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>not be an inspection or audit</li>
      <li>take approximately 3 hours- this includes your time, the farmer's time, and time for testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">It's the farmer's responsibility to pay you once the review is complete.</p>


    <h2 id="beforevisit" class="govuk-heading-m">Before you visit the farm</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before you visit the farm, the farmer will contact you to arrange a review and give you a booking reference number.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You'll need this reference number to record information after the review.</p>

    <h3 id="testing" class="govuk-heading-s">Carry out testing for endemic diseases or conditions</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must carry out testing and get any information you need from the farmer before the review. You must test for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>BVD in dairy and beef cattle</li>
      <li>PRRS in pigs</li>
      <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">Follow guidance on <a href="#">testing for priority endemic diseases or conditions</a>.</p>


  <h2 id="review" class="govuk-heading-m">Carry out a review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You should agree with the farmer how you will carry out the review and what you will check.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on the farm, you may choose to review:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>biosecurity on the farm  - check current measures and provide recommendations for improvements</li>
        <li>health and welfare  - work with the farmer to improve the health and productivity of their animals and give advice where there are issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring</li>
        <li>farm medicines  - how to prescribe and use medicines, control and treat disease including how to register and submit data  on the <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/medicine-hub" target="_blank">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a></li>
        <liL>endemic disease and condition testing - discuss test results and follow-up actions</liL>
        <li>grants and funding - support and advice on government grants and other funding available</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">At the end of the review, you must agree actions and recommendations with the farmer. This information will not be used for any regulatory or inspection purposes.</p>

      <h3 id="whenvisit" class="govuk-heading-s">When to visit</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can spread the review over several regular visits to the farm or carry out a single visit.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">A farmer may need to book multiple reviews if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>they have more than one animal type - for example, if they have cattle and sheep</li>
        <li>have livestock in multiple places</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the farm has booked multiple reviews, you can do them in one visit or separately.</p>


      <h2 id="record" class="govuk-heading-m">Record information about the review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You or a member of your team must record information about the review. This must be done no later than 3 months after you have visited the farm.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to tell us about a livestock review.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Recording information takes around 5 minutes.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">After you submit the information, the farmer can claim funding.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to give a summary report to the farmer that includes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what actions you've recommended and the farmer has agreed to</li>
          <li>information about where they can find further support </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">You should invoice the farmer using your normal process.</p>
