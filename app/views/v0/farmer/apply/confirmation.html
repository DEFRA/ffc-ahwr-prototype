      <p class="govuk-body">Thank you for applying for a livestock health and welfare review.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your application has been successful.</p>
-->
      <p class="govuk-body">We have sent you a <a href="email-application-successful">confirmation email</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you should do next</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Contact the vet to book the review.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to give the vet your booking reference number.</p>
<!--            <p class="govuk-body">If you need to find a vet, you can search the <a href="https://findavet.rcvs.org.uk/home" target="_blank">Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons list</a>.</p> -->

      <p class="govuk-body">The vet will contact you to organise testing of your livestock. They will test for:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle</li>
        <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) in pigs</li>
        <li>how effective worming treatments are in sheep</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re able to do this testing, discuss this with the vet.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The vet will discuss the test results and treatment options with you when they visit.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to apply for a new booking reference if you do not arrange a review in the next 12 months.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Confirm the record and get paid</h3>

      <p>After the vet has recorded information about the review, you’ll receive an <a href="../claim/start-email">email</a>.
        We’ll ask you to sign in to confirm the record is correct and submit your claim.</p>
      <p>You’ll receive your payment within 28 days into your Rural Payments account.</p>
